Installation and Library Import
=================================

The aforementioned HLF libraries can easily be found on our Dlubal GitHub account and is available as open-source. 
The following links will guide you to our libraries for each respective programming language.

These libraries are available for download to your local computer by clicking ‘Download ZIP’ or cloning the repository. Those with a GitHub account may clone the repository.

After downloading the whole branch, you can easily follow our examples. 
If you want to create your own file, add our branch to your path, and import functions and classes as need.

   A quick explanation to the above terminology:

   * A branch refers to different working versions of a project in GitHub. The 'main' branch, which should be selected by default, contains the latest and verified version of the project

   * Adding a branch to your path simply means storing the folders and scripts (downloaded from GitHub) in the same folder directory as your active .py file. 


This way importing of libraries can be easily done. Alternatives to this is to explicitly provide Python with a folder directory to where the HLF Libraries can be found. 
The os module, for example, can help with this by using the os.cwd() function.
